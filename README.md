Sorting / searching algorithms written in CPP

# Sort Algorithms

## Bubble Sort

Sort the array by iterating over the elements, compare the current element with the next one and swap places if bigger. Repeat until all indices are iterated.
<br>The inner loop iterates till `n-1-iterations_count` because there's no need to access `n-iterations_count` after iterating for `iterations_count`, as the right elements are already there, starting from the last index and going down.<br>The `bubble_sort_efficient()` method is more efficient, because if during a full iteration no swap was performed (meaning the array is already sorted), the loop breaks.

#### Properties
* Time complexity - Best O(n) Average O(n<sup>2</sup>) Worst O(n<sup>2</sup>)
* Space complexity - O(1)
* Stability - Yes

## Selection Sort

Sort the array by iterating over the elements with another nested iteration, save the index of the minimum value (initialized as the current index of the outer iteration and if inside the nested iteration a smaller value is found, mark it as the new minimum index).<br>The nested `for-loop` starts from `i + 1` (where `i` is the index of the outer `for-loop`) since anything below that has been placed there previously.

#### Properties
* Time complexity - Best, Average and Worst O(n<sup>2</sup>)
* Space complexity - O(1)
* Stability - No

## Insertion Sort

Iterate over the array, and compare each element with the preceding element. If the preceding element is smaller, move it forward and compare again with the previous element.<br>Repeat until either the preceding element is not smaller then the current elememt, or the beginning of the array is reached and set the current value as the index of the last element that was moved forward in position.

#### Properties
* Time complexity - Best O(n), Average and Worst O(n<sup>2</sup>)
* Space complexity - O(1)
* Stability - Yes
